            <p class="DarkBlue">My name is Riley Benson. I am 17 years old, and I go to Lemoore College, formerly known as West Hills College Lemoore. Some hobbies that I have include learning more about computer hardware and software, playing video games, being competitive in Super Smash Bros. (I main [meaning the character you use most competitively] Sonic [üîµü¶î] but my soul main [another way to say my favorite character] is King K Rool [üëëüêä] cause he's epic and fun to play as), and tinkering with Linux, my favorite computer operating system. I also used to be a concert, jazz, and marching band member back in grade school, being a Trumpet player. My goals while in college are to set myself up for a path where I can become a computer programmer / software engineer, as not only does it make lots of money and has high demand, but I also love computers.<br></p>
            <!--This is a basic overview about myself-->
            <p class="Red"><u><b>I know quite a bit about computers. Some things I do include:</b></u></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 25px;" p class="DarkBlue">
            ‚Ä¢Using Linux as my main operating system (I use Arch Linux [Vanilla or Manjaro] for personal use and Ubuntu for work use)<br>
            ‚Ä¢Working with a Linux terminal very frequently<br>
            ‚Ä¢Working with Minecraft commands (I know it sounds weird if you don't know about this, but Minecraft has a sort of "coding language" you can play around with what are called "commands" and get really cool stuff working). This is where I started my coding skills.<br>
            ‚Ä¢Working on PC hardware<br>
            ‚Ä¢Being a "tech guy" for my friends and fixing their computers<br>
            ‚Ä¢Modding my own and my friend's gaming consoles<br>
            ‚Ä¢Knowing ways to get discontinued software for personal use via archive sites that without them otherwise don't exist anymore<br></p>
            <!--This describes some of the technical talents that I have-->
            <p class="Red"><u><b>
            Some projects that I have worked on include:</b></u></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 25px;" p class="DarkBlue">
            ‚Ä¢<b>Remote emulation save files:</b> Using a program called syncthing in order to set up a remote file transfer that occurs every time my video game emulator save files get updated<br>
            ‚Ä¢<b>Modding game consoles:</b> Installing custom firmware using computer software to a gaming console, making the console capable of many things not normally accessible, such as game mods. I have done this to my PS3 and 2DS as well as my friend's 3DS, Wii, and Wii U.<br>
            ‚Ä¢<b>Resetting a friend's PC and starting its Windows experience from scratch:</b> I helped a friend who recently got a computer get a freshly installed copy of Windows and set up drivers and other tweaks that make the system have better quality of life</p>
